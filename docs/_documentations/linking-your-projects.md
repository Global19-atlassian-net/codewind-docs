# Linking your projects

You can link your projects when you are using Codewind. This feature is available in the [VS Code](#linking-your-projects-in-vs-code) and [Eclipse](#linking-your-projects-in-eclipse) IDEs.

For example, use this feature to link a front-end Node.js project to a back-end database. You have a web page front-end Node.js project without a link:

![Image of unlinked project](images/linking-feature/unlinked_project.png){:width="650px"}

You then link it to a back-end Node.js database project:

![Image of linked project](images/linking-feature/linked_project.png){:width="650px"}
